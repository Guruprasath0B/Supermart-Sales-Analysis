# Supermart Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
The "Supermart Sales Analysis" project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of a supermarket chain using Power BI. The analysis focuses on various factors such as branch performance, product line popularity, customer demographics, and payment methods. The goal is to identify key trends and patterns to inform strategic business decisions.

## Problem Statement
The supermarket chain is seeking to understand its sales performance across different branches and product lines. The management wants to identify areas for improvement and opportunities for growth by analyzing sales data. Key questions include:

- Which branches are performing the best in terms of sales and profitability?
- What are the most popular product lines?
- How do customer demographics (gender and type) affect sales?
- What payment methods are most commonly used?
- How does customer feedback (rating) correlate with sales performance?

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation
- **Excel**: For data storage and preprocessing

## Data Analysis and Solution
The analysis was conducted using Power BI, leveraging its powerful data visualization capabilities to create an interactive dashboard. The key steps included:

### Step 1: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The raw sales data was imported into Power BI and cleaned to ensure accuracy. This included handling missing values, correcting data types, and creating calculated columns for additional insights.

### Step 2: Dashboard Creation
An interactive dashboard was created to visualize various aspects of the sales data. The dashboard includes the following key components:
- **Sales Overview**: Total sales, average sales, and total transactions across all branches.
- **Branch Performance**: Sales and profitability comparison across different branches.
- **Product Line Analysis**: Sales distribution and profitability across different product lines.
- **Customer Demographics**: Analysis of sales based on customer type (Member or Normal) and gender.
- **Payment Method Analysis**: Breakdown of sales by different payment methods.
- **Customer Feedback**: Correlation between customer ratings and sales performance.

## Interpretation and Insights
- **Branch Performance**: Branch A in Yangon consistently outperforms other branches in terms of total sales and profitability. Branch C in Naypyitaw shows potential for growth with targeted marketing strategies.
- **Product Line Popularity**: 'Health and Beauty' and 'Food and Beverages' are the most popular product lines, contributing significantly to total sales.
- **Customer Demographics**: Members tend to spend more per transaction compared to normal customers, highlighting the value of loyalty programs. Female customers have a slightly higher average transaction value than male customers.
- **Payment Methods**: 'Ewallet' is the most preferred payment method, followed by 'Cash' and 'Credit Card'. This indicates a shift towards digital payments.
- **Customer Feedback**: There is a positive correlation between customer ratings and total sales, suggesting that higher-rated transactions contribute to better sales performance.
